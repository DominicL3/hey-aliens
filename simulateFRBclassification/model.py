"""Build a multi-input convolutional neural network for binary classification.
First branch takes in frequency-time data and is run through a 2D CNN, while the
second branch runs the time series of the frequency-time data through a 1D CNN.

Both network outputs are then concatenated and connected to 2 dense layers,
culminating in a softmax layer predicting the probability of classification."""
